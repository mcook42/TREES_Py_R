# TREES_Py_R

This repository has been created to store files for work that is currently in progress to translate the Terrestrial Regional Ecosystem Exchange Simulator (TREES) model from C++ to Python and R. The work will involve modularizing TREES into major components, improving code organization, and providing necessary annotation to increase accessibility to the broader ecohydrological and scientific community.
